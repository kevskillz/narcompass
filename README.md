More information on [How to Run](#how-to-run) is below.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **AWS Amplify**: For backend services and cloud integration.
- **GraphQL**: For API queries and mutations.
- **Expo**: For development and deployment.
- **Tensorflow**: Train ML custom ML model to determine overdose status based on smartwatch readings.
- **Express**: Creat a RESTful API to query ML model from our app.

## ðŸŒŸ Inspiration

Philadelphia's overdose crisis has overwhelmed emergency services. Narcan, now available over-the-counter, can save lives, but civilians often don't know where overdoses are happening. Our app provides this crucial information, enabling timely civilian intervention.

## ðŸ“± What it does

NarCompass lets victims call for help with one button, alerting hospitals and nearby Narcan carriers. It maps the quickest route for carriers to reach victims, supporting driving, walking, and biking. Callers are updated on help's progress.

Carriers can set their response range, and callers control what information is shared, stored in a cloud database for optimal response.
